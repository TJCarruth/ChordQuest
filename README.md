# ChordQuest
A synth engine for anbernic devices, desktop, and mobile.

## Intention
The [HiChord from Pocket Audio](https://hichord.shop/) made synthesizers look simple and my overconfidence in my python abilities knows no bounds. I already own a laptop and an Anbernic RG 35XX H, so this synthesizer is going to be made to suit those devices. This is not meant to be a faithful recreation of the HiChord or any other particular synthesizer, just whatever features I see and want to add. 


## Plan
Make an sythesizer engine that handles all the music, and then various input configurations so that same engine can be used on different devices. I already own an Anbernix RG 35XX H and a laptop, so I want to support both devices if possible. 
The Synthesizer engine will handle chords, drums, and looping to start. It may eventually support individual notes for melodies, or have modes to replicate old gaming console music, like the Game Boy or NES. Maybe that's too ambitious, maybe these various ideas will need to be broken up into different software, but it's direction for now.
